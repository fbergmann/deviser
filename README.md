*Deviser* stands for *"Design Explorer and
Viewer for Iterative SBML Enhancement of Representations"*.  It is a code generator for defining and prototyping [SBML Level 3](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_3) packages and code for use with [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/).

## Background ##

Computation modeling has become crucial to biological research, and [SBML](http://sbml.org) (the Systems Biology Markup Language) has become the de facto standard open format for exchanging models between software tools in systems biology.  SBML Level&nbsp;3 has a modular structure, with as a core augmented with optional packages that add syntax and features.  Development of new Level&nbsp;3 packages is ongoing.

[LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) is a free, open-source programming library to help developers read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams in their software systems. It is written in C++ and provides language bindings for other programming languages.  Support for SBML Level&nbsp;3 can be added to [LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) by integrating the package-specific code and building with the package enabled.

[Deviser](https://github.com/sbmlteam/deviser) facilitates the development of SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages by enabling the creation of basic specifications, UML diagrams and code for integration with [LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

Deviser is written in Python and is compatible with Python version 2.6 onwards.


## Using Deviser ##

### Deviser Edit GUI ###

The [Deviser Edit](https://github.com/sbmlteam/QtDeviser) tool allows you to quickly define an SBML Level&nbsp;3 package. It then provides the  following functionality

1.	Create and view a UML diagram.
2.	Generate the necessary libSBML code for the package.
3.	Generate TeX files and generate a PDF of a basic specification document for the package.
4.	Integrate and test the package with libSBML.

The Deviser Edit tool creates an XML description of the package that is used by the deviser code to generate the requested files. This XML description is exemplified in the [samples](deviser/samples) directory.

### Command Line Interface ###

There is command line version of the function that can be used to invoke Deviser on the XML file. This is the `deviser.py` file found in the generator directory.

    deviser.py [--generate][--latex] input-file.xml    

This program will use a Deviser XML file, and generate either a C++ 
libSBML extension for it, or generate a LaTeX scaffold for its 
specification. 

Full documentation is available in the [docs](deviser\docs) directory.


## Installation ##

The deviser release includes bundles/installer for each of the main operating systems.  

### Prerequisites

1. A C++ compiler must be installed if you wish to compile the libSBML code generated.
2. A pdflatex compiler must be installed if you wish to generate a PDF file from the TeX sources generated.

**NOTE**: These may already be available on your OS.

### Microsoft Windows OS

A windows installation executable which installs the Deviser Edit tool (`QtDeviser.exe`), all the necessary Deviser files. Additionally it includes a Python interpreter and the [sbmlpkgspec](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec) files for generating SBML Level&nbsp;3 Package specifications.

### Linux OS

A self-contained, binary installer is available that contains Deviser, DeviserEdit and the [sbmlpkgspec](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec) modules. After installation DeviserEdit can be run from either a desktop icon or by calling the `DeviserEdit.sh` script in the installation directory. Deviser samples can be found in the `deviser/samples` subdirectory.

### Mac OS X

A `.dmg` file is available containing the DeviserEdit Application that embeds the necessary Deviser and [sbmlpkgspec](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec) files in addition to *docs* and *samples* directories. 

### Source archives

The source archives contain the Deviser code that can be used via the command line.


## Other resources ##

Not all of the following are necessary as what is necessary depends on which operating system is being used and which Deviser functionality is required. These links are given as a quick reference.

* [libSBML source code](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libsbml 
* [libSBML dependency libraries for Windows users](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libSBML-dependencies)
* [SBML package specification template files](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec)
